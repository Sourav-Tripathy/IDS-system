Intrusion Detection system using ML algorithms
The likelihood of cyberattacks and network protocol manipulation has 
increased due to our increasing reliance on network technology and the 
internet. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for tracking and 
spotting malicious activity in order to counter these threats. The 
application of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree machine 
learning algorithms in IDS is examined in this work, and the accuracy, 
recall, precision, and F-score of each algorithm are used to assess its 
performance. The effectiveness of both algorithms is evaluated using 
Univariate feature selection with Analysis of Variance in NSL-KDD 
dataset. The Decision Tree algorithm performs better than KNN across 
the board, according to the results, proving the value of machine learning 
techniques in improving IDS performance.
